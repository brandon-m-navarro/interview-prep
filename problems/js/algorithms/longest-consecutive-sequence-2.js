/**
 * Longest Consecutive Sequence
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
 * consecutive elements sequence that can be formed.
 * 
 * NOTE: This doesn't necessarily mean the numbers appear in order [1, 2, 3...]
 * in the nums array, but that a sequence can be formed:
 * [1, 100, 2, 100, 3] -> 3 ([1, 2, 3]).
 *
 * The algorithm should run in O(n) time.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *   0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 *   -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
