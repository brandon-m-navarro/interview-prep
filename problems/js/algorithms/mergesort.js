/**
 * Merge Sort
 * 
 * Given an unordered array of integers, sort them into ascending order. Your
 * algorithm should take a recursive approach, and follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Divide: Split the problem into smaller subproblems
 * 2. Conquer: Solve the subproblems recursively
 * 3. Combine: Merge the solutions to solve the original problem
 * 
 * What is the time & space complexity of your solution, and why?
