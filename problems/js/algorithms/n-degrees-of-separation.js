/**
 * N-Degrees of Separation
 * 
 * Given a starting Person and the name of a target (string), determine the
 * number of degrees of separation between the two. If the two people are not
 * connected, return -1.
 * 
 * For example, if Joe has 3 friends (Person.friends), all three of those
 * friends are 1 degree of separation away.
 * 
 * If Audrey has one friend (Audrey.getFriends() -> [Tom]), and Tom has 2
 * friends (Tom.getFriends() -> [Audrey, Saria]), Audrey is 2 degrees of
 * separation away from Saria.
 * 
 * People who are friends always have each other as friends (wholesome).
 * For example, using the last example, Audrey appears in Tom's friend
 * array and Tom appears in Aubrey's friend array.
