/**
 * Longest Consecutive Sequence
 *
 * Given a sorted array of unique integers nums, return the length of the
 * longest consecutive elements sequence. NOTE: This means the numbers will
 * appear IN ORDER. [1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5] -> 3 ([3, 4, 5]). Look at the
 * associated test file for more examples.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *   0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 *   -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
