# REST API Design

Image that you are building Twitter. In particular, you are in charge of designing an API for Twitter's backend. This API will be used by a developer building a 3rd party Twitter client. 

#### What actions would you expose and what HTTP method would you use for each?

#### What are some ways you could scale your Twitter service to accomodate a high user load?
